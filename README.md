# This is forked from demo content to learn nextjs.

Why do I want to learn [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)? 

I've learned [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) before. It is my current frontend stack at work. By the way, I implement the server-side by PHP for routing and handle some kinds of stuff like fetching default data for the client-side at first page loads. I think why don't I keeping learn the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) HTTP server to write Javascript to run on both server-side and client-side. I start searching on google like "Top node server I should learn first". After that, [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) is my first choice. I continue searching for mixed Expressjs and Reactjs like MERN stack (aka MongoDB for database, Expressjs for server, Reactjs for client and Node for runtime environment). I must implement the server-side logic by Expressjs and implement client-side logic by Reactjs. Wow, I could do everything in one language. How cool is that?

Suddenly, I think it's not cool at all.
I want to build a simple single web page like render UI by Reactjs (server-rendered for the first page loads and client-rendered for the next time) and fetch data from REST API. How can I do that?

I'm always anxious. I keep doing research to find a solution for that. I've found the Next.js. It really helpful framework using Reactjs.

Here are some features Next.js bring to us:
- Zero configuration for Babel, Webpack by default (any way you can customize for your own)
- Server-rendered by default (help for SEO or first look website without awaiting)
- Simple routing (page based)
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Able to implement with Node.js HTTP server
